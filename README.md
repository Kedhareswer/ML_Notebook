ML Notebook is an interactive educational platform designed to help students, developers, and enthusiasts learn about machine learning and deep learning models through a hands-on, structured approach with consistent learning experiences across all models.

## 🎯 Features

### 📚 Consistent Learning Structure
Every model page follows a three-part structure:
- **Overview**: Comprehensive explanation of theory, key concepts, and applications
- **Interactive Demo**: Visual demonstrations with adjustable parameters
- **Code Implementation**: Practical examples with executable code cells

### 🎓 Structured Learning Paths

1. **Foundations**
   - Statistical Learning Theory
   - Model Evaluation
   - Bias-Variance Tradeoff

2. **Regression Models**
   - Linear Regression
   - Polynomial Regression
   - Ridge & Lasso Regression

3. **Classification Models**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees
   - Support Vector Machines
   - Random Forests

4. **Deep Learning**
   - Multilayer Perceptron
   - Convolutional Neural Networks
   - Recurrent Neural Networks
   - Transformers

### 🔍 Interactive Features

- **Real-time Parameter Tuning**: Manipulate model parameters and see immediate effects
- **Visual Learning**: Interactive plots and diagrams
- **Code Execution**: Run and modify code examples directly in the browser
- **Model Comparisons**: Compare different models side-by-side
